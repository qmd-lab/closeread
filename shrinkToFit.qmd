| {#longpoem .cr-poem cr-id="mypoem"}
| I was given a name, it came out of a book—
| I don’t know which. I’ve been told the Great Man
| could recite every title in order on its shelf.
| Well, [I was born]{#cr-born}, and that’s a good thing,
| although I arrived on the day of his passing,
| 
| a day on which our country fell into mourning.
| This I heard over and over, from professors
| to farmers, even duel-scarred students;
| sometimes, in grand company, remarked upon
| in third person—a pretty way of saying
| 
| more than two men in a room means the third
| can be ignored, as [I was when they spoke]{#cr-birth1}
| [of my birth]{#cr-birth2} and Mr. Jefferson’s death
| in one breath, voices [dusted with wonderment]{#cr-wonder},
| faint sunlight quivering on a hidden breeze.
