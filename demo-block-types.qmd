# Test other sticky block types

First paragraph.

::: {}
This is a para nested in a div. These two first bits don't trigger anything...
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-to="pink"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on the div.
:::

:::{cr-id="pink"}
x![This is a caption](pink-desktop.png)
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="pink" cr-to="blue"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on Image itself.

I've replaced its margin with some padding to demonstrate that you can give it a larger "surface" area on which to trigger scroll events.
:::

![](blue-desktop.png){cr-id="blue"}

::::

::::{.column-screen-inset style="background-color: #dddddd; padding: 50px;"}
Here's a little non-scrolling interlude before our next scrolly section!
::::

::::{.cr-layout}

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-to="scatter"}
This is a scatterplot.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cr-id: scatter

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$dist)
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="scatter" cr-to="hist"}
This is a histogram.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| cr-id: hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a caption."
#| fig-height: 4

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="hist" cr-to="list"}
This is a list (a block element).
:::

:::{cr-id="list"}
1. Apple
2. Banana
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="list" cr-to="displaymath"}
This is display math, but I'm making it a bit longer so that it covers a few lines.
:::

::: {cr-id="displaymath"}

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
&= 3.4 + 1.2 x
\end{align}
$$

:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="displaymath" cr-to="mypoem"}
This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems).
:::

| {#longpoem .cr-poem cr-id="mypoem"}
| I was given a name, it came out of a book—
| I don’t know which. I’ve been told the Great Man
| could recite every title in order on its shelf.
| Well, [I was born]{#cr-born}, and that’s a good thing,
| although I arrived on the day of his passing,
| 
| a day on which our country fell into mourning.
| This I heard over and over, from professors
| to farmers, even duel-scarred students;
| sometimes, in grand company, remarked upon
| in third person—a pretty way of saying
| 
| more than two men in a room means the third
| can be ignored, as [I was when they spoke]{#cr-birth1}
| [of my birth]{#cr-birth2} and Mr. Jefferson’s death
| in one breath, voices [dusted with wonderment]{#cr-wonder},
| faint sunlight quivering on a hidden breeze.


:::{cr-in="mypoem" cr-highlight="cr-born"}
The author refers to their birth twice: one here...
:::

:::{cr-in="mypoem" cr-highlight="cr-birth1,cr-birth2"}
... and again, further down.

Interestingly, Pandoc doesn't let you carry a span across two lines in a line block!
:::

:::{cr-in="mypoem" cr-highlight="cr-wonder"}
But check out this phrase, right at the bottom.
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="mypoem" cr-to="mylimerick"}
Let's look at a small limmerick.
:::

| {#something .cr-poem cr-id="mylimerick" myattr="true"}
| The limerick packs [laughs anatomical]{#cr-laughs}
|   In space that is quite economical.

:::{cr-in="mylimerick" cr-highlight="cr-laughs"}
The phrase 'laughs anatomical' is quite important here!
:::

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="mylimerick" cr-to="mermaid"}
This is a mermaid diagram
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| cr-id: mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="mermaid" cr-to="graphviz"}
This is a graphviz diagram
:::

```{dot}
//| cr-id: graphviz
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
}
```

:::{.cr-crossfade cr-from="graphviz" cr-to="pre-block"}
Here is an verbatim, pre-formatted block.
:::

:::{cr-id="pre-block"}
```
this is the first   line
this is the second line
```
