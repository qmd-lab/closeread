closeread is a custom format for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that enables scrollytelling features for html documents.

Install the extension by running the following command in the directory you wish to use it:

```bash
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```

With the extension installed, you can author documents using the `closeread-html` format:

```yaml
---
title: My First Closeread
format: closeread-html
---
```

::::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

Get your first closeread doc up and running in four steps. @cr-doc

Step one: create a qmd file and set the format to closeread-html. [@cr-doc]{highlight="3"}

Step two: open up a closeread section. [@cr-doc]{highlight="8-20"}

Step three: flag an element to become a sticky. [@cr-doc]{highlight="14-18"}

Step four: create a trigger to make the sticky appear. [@cr-doc]{highlight="12"}
