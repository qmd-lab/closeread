## Getting started {#gettingstarted}

```{=html}
<style>
  .cr-section .narrative-col {
    font-size: 1.4em;
  }

  .cr-section .sticky-col {
    font-size: 0.6em;
  }
</style>
```

Closeread is a custom format for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that enables scrollytelling features for html documents.

Install the extension by running the following command in the directory you wish to use it:

```bash
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```

With the extension installed, you can author documents using the `closeread-html` format:

```yaml
---
title: My First Closeread
format: closeread-html
---
```

\
\

::::{.cr-section layout="overlay-center" style="font-size: 1.5em;"}

Get your first Closeread doc up and running in four steps. @cr-doc

Step one: create a qmd file and set the format to closeread-html. [@cr-doc]{highlight="3"}

Step two: open up a Closeread section. [@cr-doc]{highlight="8-20"}

Step three: flag an element to become a sticky. [@cr-doc]{highlight="14-18"}

Step four: create a trigger to make the sticky appear. [@cr-doc]{highlight="12"}

:::{style="height: 40dvh; visibility: hidden"}
:::

Triggers, like this text, scroll past while the stickies stay "stuck" on the page. [@cr-doc]{highlight=""}

:::{#cr-doc filename="myfirstcr.qmd" .scale-to-fill}

## What's next?

For guidance on how to author Closeread documents, read the [Guide](guide/index.qmd), starting with [Components of a Closeread document](guide/components.qmd). These components are the essential building blocks of scrollytelling with Closeread. Follow the rest of the Guide for ways to add more advanced effects.

### Publishing

When you're ready to let the world (or just a few people) see your work, check out the [Quarto publishing section](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) of the Guide. Closeread documents follow the same publishing rules as other Quarto documents, so if you've worked with Quarto before, you're already already to go! Likewise, if you've published other static web pages before, you can take the files created by `quarto render` and put them anywhere on the web.

### Gallery and Reference

Need some inspiration? For examples of Closeread documents alongside their source, consult the [Gallery](gallery/index.qmd) to see how we made them. The Gallery also has examples that highlight particular features of Closeread.

If you can't remember a particular option that Closeread uses, see the [Reference](reference/index.qmd).
