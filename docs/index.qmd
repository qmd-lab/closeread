closeread is a custom format for [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) that enables scrollytelling features for html documents.

Install the extension by running the following command in the directory you wish to use it:

```bash
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```

With the extension installed, you can author documents using the `closeread-html` format:

```yaml
---
title: My First Closeread
format: closeread-html
---
```

For a catalog of the syntax and yaml options used in the closeread extension, see the [Reference](reference/index.qmd).
