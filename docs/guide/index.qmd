If you've never made a Closeread document, copy and paste the following document into a qmd document.

```{.markdown filename="myfirstcr.qmd"}

title: My First Closeread
format: closeread-html

Hello World! Please read my closeread story below.

Closeread enables scrollytelling.

Draw your readers attention with focus effects. @cr-features

:::{#cr-features}

```

In the same directory as this qmd file, run the following command to make the Closeread extension available to this document.

```bash
quarto add qmd-lab/closeread
```

Now you can render the document and scroll through your first scrollytelling story. Continue the adventure by reading about the [Components of a Closeread Document](components.qmd).

When you've finished the Guide, be sure to have a look at the [Gallery](/gallery) for more examples of what you can do with Closeread!

This is an open-source tool built upon other open-source tools. Closeread extends [Quarto](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli), a tool for technical publishing sponsored by Posit, PBC. The responsivity to user scrolling is made possible by the [scrollama v3.0](https://github.com/russellsamora/scrollama) JavaScript library by Russell Samora.
