Because James is less experienced with Python, these Jupyter examples are taken from the [Quarto documentation page]
(https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/widgets/jupyter.html):

Here's one type of widget... @cr-widget-leaflet

... that is a map! Note it's a figure (it has a caption down below). @cr-widget-leaflet

::::{#cr-widget-leaflet}

:::{#fig-leaflet}

```{python}
from ipyleaflet import Map, Marker, basemaps, basemap_to_tiles

m = Map(
  basemap = basemap_to_tiles(
    basemaps.NASAGIBS.ModisTerraTrueColorCR, "2017-04-08"
  ),
  center = (52.204793, 360.121558),
  zoom = 4
)
m.add_layer(Marker(location = (52.204793, 360.121558)))

m
```

This is a great map!

And another. This one's a chart rendered with plotly. @cr-widget-plotly

Plotly doesn't seem to use Jupyter widgets â€” it's doing its own thing with several layered SVGs.  
This needs more work. @cr-widget-plotly

::::{#cr-widget-plotly}
```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import plotly.io as pio
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x = "sepal_width", y = "sepal_length", 
                 color = "species", 
                 marginal_y = "violin", marginal_x = "box", 
                 trendline = "ols", template = "simple_white")
fig.show()
```
