Something something video

Now here's an example of a video filling to fit the space:

::::{.cr-section layout="overlay-left"}

You can tell all sorts of stories with videos.

Maybe you've gone on a journey.

![](ship.mp4){#cr-ship .scale-to-cover alt="A ship sails in a polar region" autoplay="true" loop="true"}

Apply the `.scale-to-cover` class to videos to ensure that they fill up the whole Closeread sticky column (even if they need to be cropped to do it). @cr-tea

This is great for photojournalistic use cases like interviews where not every part of the frame needs to be visible. @cr-tea

The works for sidebar layouts too:

\
\

::::{.cr-section layout="sidebar-right"}

The video may even be there simply to establish a mood for your story.

![](tea.mp4){#cr-tea .scale-to-cover alt="One person pours tea into another person's tea cup in front of an open fire." autoplay="true" loop="true"}

:::{focus-on="cr-tea"}
You may want to add `autoplay="true"` and `loop="true"` to your videos.
\
\
In this case, we've shifted the video and put a crossfade in the middle of it for a seamless loop.
