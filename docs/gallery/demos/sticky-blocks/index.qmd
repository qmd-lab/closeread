Just about any type of element that can be included in a Quarto doc can be flagged as a sticky. This demo shows many examples.

The current fix allows `.cr-section` to work, provided it's a "first level" child of the `main` content. For example:

::::{.cr-section}

This is an image that includes a caption. @cr-inline-working

:::{#cr-inline-working}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This does too! @cr-nocaption-working

:::{#cr-nocaption-working}
![](trees.png)
:::

::::

But things fall apart if you put one inside a `section` (which Quarto creates from an `h2`).

## Images

::::{.cr-section}

This is an image that includes a caption. @cr-inline-working2

:::{#cr-inline-working2}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This does too! @cr-nocaption-working2

:::{#cr-nocaption-working2}
![](trees.png)
:::

::::

Adding `.page-columns.page-full` to the `section` appears to fix this problem (but how do we want to do it? And do we need to account for sidebar content?)
