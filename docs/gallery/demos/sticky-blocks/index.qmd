Just about any type of element that can be included in a Quarto doc can be flagged as a sticky. This demo shows many examples.

The current fix allows `.cr-section` to work, provided it's a "first level" child of the `main` content. For example:

::::{.cr-section}

This is an image that includes a caption. @cr-inline-working

:::{#cr-inline-working}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This does too! @cr-nocaption-working

:::{#cr-nocaption-working}
![](trees.png)
:::

Does this one, which has a caption but no content? @cr-caption-working

:::{#cr-caption-working}
![Look at this tree!](trees.png)
:::

## This header becomes a section

We've reimplemented `.column-screen` so that we can even make `.cr-section` work if you've used an `h2` (which puts parts of the doc inside a `section`):

::::{.cr-section}

This is an image that includes a caption. @cr-inline-working2

:::{#cr-inline-working2}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This does too! @cr-nocaption-working2

:::{#cr-nocaption-working2}
![](trees.png)
:::

Does this one, which has a caption but no content? @cr-caption-working2

:::{#cr-caption-working2}
![Look at this tree!](trees.png)
