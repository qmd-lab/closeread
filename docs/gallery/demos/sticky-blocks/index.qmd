Just about any type of element that can be included in a Quarto doc can be flagged as a sticky. This demo shows many examples.

## Images

::::{.cr-section}

This is an image that includes a caption. @cr-inline-working

:::{#cr-inline-working}
This works: ![a caption](trees.png)
:::

This does too! @cr-nocaption-working

:::{#cr-nocaption-working}
![](trees.png)
:::

What about this, though? (Remove the image below to see things working as intended!) @cr-caption-notworking

:::{#cr-caption-notworking}
![This figure breaks the layout...](trees.png)
