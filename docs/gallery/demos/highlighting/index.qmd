Closeread enables the [highlighting](../../../guide/focus-effects.html#highlighting) of both code and text using a similar syntax.

To highlight particular lines of code for your reader, you can add an attribute to your trigger called `highlight`. To highlight lines of code, you can either use a series of line numbers separated by commas or a range separate by a hyphen. Some examples:

- `highlight="1,5"`: highlight lines 1 and 5
- `highlight="1-5"`: highlight lines 1 through 5

The following section demonstrates that functionality. Note that all stickies use `.scale-to-fill`

:::{.cr-section}
We'll show an example that demonstrates the use of the `dplyr` R package for data wrangling.

Here is a `dplyr` pipeline that processes a data frame containing information on Antarctic penguins. @cr-dplyr

In the first two lines we load the `dplyr` package and the `palmerpenguins` package, which contains the data frame. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="1,2"}

The main block of code is referred as a pipeline or chain. Each line starts with a function and ends with a pipe, `|>`. [@cr-dplyr]{highlight="4-8"}

:::{#cr-dplyr .scale-to-fill}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |>
  filter(year == 2008) |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm)) |>
  arrange(avg_bill_length)
```

The syntax for a lineblock (like a poem) is the same, with one addition.

- `highlight="cr-myspan"`: highlight particular span within a lineblock


:::{.cr-section}
The limerick is a form of poetry composed of five lines.

Here is the first limerick appearing in the written record, from the *Saint John Daily News* in 1880. @cr-limerick

The end of the first two lines of a Limerick must rhyme. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="cr-mallory,cr-salary"}

The end of the third and fourth line also rhyme and are nudged in a bit. [@cr-limerick]{highlight="3-4"}

| {#cr-limerick .scale-to-fill}
| There was a young rustic named [Mallory]{#cr-mallory},
| who drew but a very small [salary]{#cr-salary}.
|   When he went to the show,
|   his purse made him go
| to a seat in the uppermost gallery.
