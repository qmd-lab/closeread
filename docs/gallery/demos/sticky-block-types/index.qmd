# Test other sticky block types

First paragraph.

::: {}
This is a para nested in a div. These two first bits don't trigger anything...
:::

:::{focus-on="pink"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on the div.
:::

:::{#cr-pink}
x![This is a caption](pink-desktop.png)
:::

:::{focus-on="blue"}
This is an image with the sticky tag on Image itself.

I've replaced its margin with some padding to demonstrate that you can give it a larger "surface" area on which to trigger scroll events.
:::

![](blue-desktop.png){#cr-blue}

::::

::::{.column-screen-inset style="background-color: #dddddd; padding: 50px;"}
Here's a little non-scrolling interlude before our next scrolly section!
::::

::::{.cr-layout}

:::{focus-on="scatter"}
This is a scatterplot.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| id: cr-scatter

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$dist)
```

:::{focus-on="hist"}
This is a histogram.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| id: cr-hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a caption."
#| fig-height: 4

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

:::{focus-on="list"}
This is a list (a block element).
:::

:::{#cr-list}
1. Apple
2. Banana
:::

:::{focus-on="displaymath"}
This is display math, but I'm making it a bit longer so that it covers a few lines.
:::

::: {#cr-displaymath}

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
&= 3.4 + 1.2 x
\end{align}
$$

:::

:::{focus-on="mypoem"}
This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems).
:::

| {#cr-mypoem .cr-poem}
| I was given a name, it came out of a book—
| I don’t know which. I’ve been told the Great Man
| could recite every title in order on its shelf.
| Well, [I was born]{#born}, and that’s a good thing,
| although I arrived on the day of his passing,
| 
| a day on which our country fell into mourning.
| This I heard over and over, from professors
| to farmers, even duel-scarred students;
| sometimes, in grand company, remarked upon
| in third person—a pretty way of saying
| 
| more than two men in a room means the third
| can be ignored, as [I was when they spoke]{#birth1}
| [of my birth]{#birth2} and Mr. Jefferson’s death
| in one breath, voices [dusted with wonderment]{#wonder},
| faint sunlight quivering on a hidden breeze.


:::{focus-on="mypoem" highlight-spans="born"}
The author refers to their birth twice: one here...
:::

:::{focus-on="mypoem" highlight-spans="birth1,birth2"}
... and again, further down.

Interestingly, Pandoc doesn't let you carry a span across two lines in a line block!
:::

:::{focus-on="mypoem" highlight-spans="wonder"}
But check out this phrase, right at the bottom.
:::

:::{focus-on="mylimerick"}
Let's look at a small limerick.
:::

| {#cr-mylimerick}
| The limerick packs [laughs anatomical]{#laughs}
|   In space that is quite economical.

:::{focus-on="mylimerick" highlight-spans="laughs"}
The phrase 'laughs anatomical' is quite important here!
:::

:::{focus-on="mermaid"}
This is a mermaid diagram
:::

```{mermaid}
%%| id: cr-mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

:::{focus-on="graphviz"}
This is a graphviz diagram
:::

```{dot}
//| id: cr-graphviz
graph G {
  layout=neato
  run -- intr;
  intr -- runbl;
}
```

:::

# The End
