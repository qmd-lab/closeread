# A Poem (and a Painting) About the Suffering That Hides in Plain Sight

By Elisa Gabbert March 6, 2002
:::

I’ve been reading this short, wry poem about suffering for more than 20 years.

How nice that it tells you in the first two words what it’s about. [@cr-musee]{hlz="cr-suffering"}

No matter how familiar a poem is, rereading it always gives me a sense of first encounter, as though I’ve gone back to sleep and re-entered the dream through a different door.

| **MUSÉE DES BEAUX ARTS**
| *by W.H. Auden*
| 
| [About suffering]{#cr-suffering} they were never wrong,
| The old Masters: how well they understood
| Its human position; how it takes place
| While someone else is eating or opening a window 
|     or just walking dully along;
| How, when the aged are reverently, passionately waiting
| For the miraculous birth, there always must be
| Children who did not specially want it to happen, skating
| On a pond at the edge of the wood:
| They never forgot
| That even the dreadful martyrdom must run its course
| Anyhow in a corner, some untidy spot
| Where the dogs go on with their doggy life and the torturer's horse
| Scratches its innocent behind on a tree.
| 
| In Breughel's *Icarus*, for instance: how everything turns away
| Quite leisurely from the disaster; the ploughman may
| Have heard the splash, the forsaken cry,
| But for him it was not an important failure; the sun shone
| As it had to on the white legs disappearing into the green
| Water, and the expensive delicate ship that must have seen
| Something amazing, a boy falling out of the sky,
| Had somewhere to get to and sailed calmly on.
