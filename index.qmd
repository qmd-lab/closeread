# Test other sticky block types

First paragraph.

This is a para nested in a div. These two first bits don't trigger anything...

This is an image with the sticky tag on the div. @cr-pink

:::{#cr-pink}
![This is a caption](pink-desktop.png)
:::

This is an image with the sticky tag on Image itself. @cr-blue

![](blue-desktop.png){#cr-blue}

Here's a little non-scrolling interlude before our next scrolly section!

::::{.cr-section}

This is a scatterplot. @cr-scatterplot

:::{#cr-scatterplot}
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| id: cr-scatter

plot(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$dist)
```
:::

This is a histogram. @cr-hist

:::{#cr-hist}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| id: cr-hist
#| fig-cap: "This is a caption."
#| fig-height: 4

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

This is a list (a block element). @cr-list

:::{#cr-list}
1. Apple
2. Banana

This is display math, but I'm making it a bit longer so that it covers a few lines. @cr-displaymath

::: {#cr-displaymath}

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{y} &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon \\
&= 3.4 + 1.2 x
\end{align}

This is a poem. It's called ["Bellringer", by Rita Dove](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2019-in-review/our-year-in-poems). @cr-mypoem

:::{#cr-mypoem .cr-poem}
| I was given a name, it came out of a book—
| I don’t know which. I’ve been told the Great Man
| could recite every title in order on its shelf.
| Well, [I was born]{#cr-born}, and that’s a good thing,
| although I arrived on the day of his passing,
| 
| a day on which our country fell into mourning.
| This I heard over and over, from professors
| to farmers, even duel-scarred students;
| sometimes, in grand company, remarked upon
| in third person—a pretty way of saying
| 
| more than two men in a room means the third
| can be ignored, as [I was when they spoke]{#cr-birth1}
| [of my birth]{#cr-birth2} and Mr. Jefferson’s death
| in one breath, voices [dusted with wonderment]{#cr-wonder},
| faint sunlight quivering on a hidden breeze.

The author refers to their birth twice: one here... [@cr-mypoem]{highlight="cr-born"}

... and again, further down. [@cr-mypoem]{highlight="cr-birth1,cr-birth2"}

Interestingly, Pandoc doesn't let you carry a span across two lines in a line block!

But check out this phrase, right at the bottom. [@cr-mypoem]{highlight="cr-wonder"}

Let's look at a small limerick. @cr-mylimerick

| {#cr-mylimerick .cr-poem}
| The limerick packs [laughs anatomical]{#cr-laughs}
|   In space that is quite economical.

The phrase 'laughs anatomical' is quite important here! [@cr-mylimerick]{highlight="cr-laughs"}
